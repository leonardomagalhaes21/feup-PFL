# PFL - Projects 1 & 2 Summary

## Project 1: Shortest Path & TSP Solver

This project implements two algorithms for graph-based pathfinding:

### Shortest Path
- Uses **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to find the shortest route between two cities.

### Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)
- Uses a **modified BFS** to find a route visiting all cities while minimizing travel distance.

### Features
- Efficient queue-based path exploration.
- Property-based testing with **QuickCheck** for reliability.

## Project 2: Mabula Game

Mabula is a **Prolog-based** board game where two players move marbles to form connected groups.

### Features
- **8x8 board**, randomized marble placement.
- Two rule variations for winning conditions.
- AI with **random (easy) & greedy (hard) difficulty levels**.
- **Text-based interface with input validation**.
